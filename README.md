# webscrapeAndDataVisualization

This minor project scrapes all concerts of Red Hot Chili Peppers.
Date, Venue, Tour and songlist is gathered. The data is augmented with geolocation, using openstreetmap api and gmaps api.
In the inital steps, the data is stored as json, but is then converted to csv.

Datahandling and visualization is then handled with dash/plotly and pandas.

Further improvement would be to use the API instead of webscraping, and a better frontend framework.
